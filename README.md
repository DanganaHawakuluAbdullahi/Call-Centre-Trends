# Call Centre Trends Analysis
<img src="Intro.jpg" width="1100">

## Introduction
This capstone project represents a pivotal component of my training at GIT AFRICA's bootcamp. The objective was to immerse ourselves in a real-world dataset obtained online, challenging our skills in acquiring data from the internet. The project demanded expertise in data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and analysis, culminating in the creation of a robust and impactful dashboard. This hands-on experience served as a comprehensive test of our abilities in handling end-to-end data processes.

## Problem statement
Creating a dashboard in powerBI to reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics in the dataset:
1.	What is the overall satisfactory rating for agents?
2.	What is the performance of agents by calls count?
3.	What is the average speed of answer by agents?
4.	What is the distribution of calls by time?
5.	Which topics are mostly been resolved?

## Data Sourcing
The program director of the bootcamp directed us to forage a website for data. Following this guidance, I downloaded the CSV file from the website and proceeded to extract it into Power BI for cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
It contains a single sheet/table:
CALL CENTRE TREND with 5,000 rows and 10 columns

## Data Transformation/Cleaning
Efficient data cleaning and transformation were executed using the Power Query Editor within Power BI. Key steps in this process included:
-	Setting the first row as the header in the CALL CENTRE TRANDS table.
-	Eliminating null values from the dataset.
-	Correcting erroneous data types to ensure accuracy and consistency.

## Data modelling
The dataset contains a single table for this analysis, so modelling was not required.

## Visualization
The report comprises of 5 tiles
    1. Overall satisfactory rating for agents
    2. Agents performance by calls count
    3. Average speed of answer
    4. Top 3 calls distribution by time
    5. Topic resolution
